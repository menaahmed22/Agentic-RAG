# 🧠 Agentic RAG: Multi-Agent PDF + Web Question Answering System

An intelligent multi-agent RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system powered by **CrewAI**, capable of answering user questions using both a **PDF document** and the **web** as information sources. The system routes, retrieves, verifies, and formats answers — returning a clean, Markdown-formatted response.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Agent-based architecture using CrewAI
- 📄 Loads and searches PDF for relevant information
- 🌐 Falls back to web search if the PDF lacks the answer
- 🔍 Verifies accuracy before returning results
- 📝 Outputs final answers in Markdown format
- 🧩 Modular design: easily extend or customize agents/tools
## 📌 Use Case

Ask any question and provide a PDF. The system attempts to find the answer in the PDF. If not found, it automatically searches the web, verifies the response, and returns a polished Markdown-formatted answer.

## 💡 How It Works
1-Router Agent >>decides whether to use PDF or Web based on the question.

2-Retriever Agent >>fetches relevant content from the selected source.

3-Verifier Agent >>uses an LLM to check the factuality of the retrieved answer.

4-Formatter Agent >> outputs the final answer in Markdown.
